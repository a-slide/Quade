Simple and double indexing are supported.\r\n* Reads can be filtered to exclude index read with bad quality base (to avoid sample cross contamination due to errors in index read)\r\n* The program handle stochastic molecular index. Sample index and molecular index are appended at the end of sequence name for further use.\r\n\r\n![Double index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-slide/Quade/master/doc/img/modified_illumina_adapters.png)\r\n\r\n## Principle\r\n\r\n1. A configuration file containing all program parameters (including sample/index association) is parsed and thoroughly verified for validity\r\n2. Non demultiplexed fastq files are read chunks by chunks, with reads from sample read1, sample read2, index read1 [and index read2] in different files.\r\n3. sample barcode and molecular index sequence are extracted from index read. In the case of double indexing sample barcode is the result of the fusion between sample barcode from index1 and index2. The same applies for molecular index \r\n4. Depending of the index (or fused index) sequence, sample reads1 and read2 are attributed to a defined sample, or to the undetermined category if appropriate.\r\n5. The phred quality of the index read is checked so as every positions is above a defined minimal value. If so reads are written in a sample **pass** file, else reads are written in a sample **fail** file.\r\n6. reads names are written as follow : *@Name_in_original_fastq:SAMPLE_BARCODE[:MOLECULAR_BARCODE]*\r\n7. a distribution report is generated\r\n\r\n![Quade](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-slide/Quade/master/doc/img/quade-io.png)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\nThe program was developed under Linux Mint 17 and require a python 2.7 environment.\r\nThe following dependencies are required for proper program execution:\r\n\r\n* python package [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) 1.7.1+\r\n* python package [HTSeq](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/index.html#) 0.6.1p1+\r\n\r\nIf you have pip already installed, enter the following line to install packages: ```sudo pip install numpy HTSeq```\r\n\r\n## Get and install Quade\r\n\r\n* Clone the repository or download the archive ```git clone https://github.com/a-slide/Quade.git```\r\n\r\n* Enter the src folder of the program folder and make the main script executable ```sudo chmod u+x Quade.py```\r\n\r\n* Finally, Add Quade.py to your PATH\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIn the folder where fastq files will be created\r\n    \r\n    Usage: Quade.py -c Conf.txt [-i -h]\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n      --version     show program's version number and exit\r\n      -h, --help    show this help message and exit\r\n      -c CONF_FILE  Path to the configuration file [Mandatory]\r\n      -i            Generate an example configuration file and exit [Facultative]\r\n      \r\nAn example configuration file can be generated by running the program with the option -i\r\nThe configuration of options is described directly in the configuration file.\r\nThe program can be tested from the test folder with the dataset provided and the default configuration file.\r\n```\r\ncd ./test/result\r\nQuade.py -i\r\nQuade.py -c Conf_file.txt\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n\r\nSee Blog post [Starting a new NGS project with python : Example with a fastq demultiplexer](http://a-slide.github.io/blog/fastq_demultiplexer)\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contact\r\n\r\nAdrien Leger - 2014\r\n\r\n* <adrien.leger@gmail.com> - <adrien.leger@inserm.fr> - <adrien.leger@univ-nantes.fr>\r\n* [Github](https://github.com/a-slide)\r\n* [Atlantic Gene Therapies - INSERM 1089](http://www.atlantic-gene-therapies.fr/)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
